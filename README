DevSuiteSDK
===========
The DevSuiteSDK is a Software Development Kit for Aptina's USB Demo Hardware (Demo2X, Demo3).
For the full DevSuite Installation for Windows go to http://www.aptina.com/support/Devsuite.jsp

This distribution includes some of the basic libraries/APIs which are now available for Mac OS X and Linux

This distribution now includes the DevWareX application.  DevWareX is a Qt based version of DevWare that runs on Mac, Linux and Windows.  This is an early release of the application, so it doesn't include all of the features.  Please see the release notes for what is currently supported.  

There are two sample applications currently available.  SimpleCapture (samples/SimpleCapture) is a command line application that grabs an image from the demo camera.
It is based on the ApBase library.  SimpleQt is a GUI based Qt application that displays the images from the demo camera.  This is also based on the ApBase library.

The non-NDA data files are located in apps_data (initialization files) and sensor_data (register reference file).  
For other parts please copy your data files into these directories.
